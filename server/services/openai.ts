Brand Name: ${brandName}
Keywords: ${keywords.join(", ")}
Industry: ${industry || "Not specified"}

Generate queries that would help discover:
1. Direct brand mentions and discussions
2. Industry news that might reference the brand
3. Competitor comparisons that include the brand
4. Product/service reviews and mentions
5. Recent news, announcements, or developments
6. Expert opinions or analysis mentioning the brand

Each query should be:
- Natural and conversational (as a real user would ask)
- Likely to generate responses that mention ${brandName}
- Varied in approach (news, comparisons, reviews, industry discussions)
- Specific enough to be relevant but broad enough to capture various mention contexts

Respond with a JSON object containing an array of query strings: { "queries": ["query1", "query2", ...] }`;
